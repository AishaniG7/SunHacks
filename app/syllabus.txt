General Essay Syllabus
1. Introduction (10–15%)

Hook: Start with a compelling opening (a surprising fact, question, or quote) to capture interest.

Context: Briefly explain the background of the topic to set up why it matters.

Thesis Statement: Present your central argument or main idea clearly and concisely.

Roadmap: (Optional) Outline the key points you will cover in the body paragraphs.

2. Body Paragraphs (70–80%)

Each body paragraph should:

Topic Sentence: Introduce the main idea of the paragraph (ties back to thesis).

Evidence/Examples: Provide data, quotations, case studies, or logical reasoning to support the point.

Analysis: Explain why the evidence matters and how it supports your thesis.

Transition: Lead smoothly into the next paragraph.

Typical Structure for Body Sections:

Paragraph 1: First major point (strongest or most foundational).

Paragraph 2: Second major point (supporting or comparative).

Paragraph 3: Third major point (counterargument + rebuttal, or a future implication).

Tip: Use 3–4 paragraphs for a standard essay, more for longer essays (research papers, dissertations).

3. Counterarguments (Optional but Recommended)

Present an opposing perspective fairly and thoughtfully.

Refute it with evidence and reasoning to strengthen your own position.

4. Conclusion (10–15%)

Restate Thesis: Summarize the argument in a fresh way.

Synthesize Key Points: Show how the body paragraphs connected to support your argument.

Closing Insight: End with a thought-provoking idea, call to action, or prediction about the future.

5. References (If Required)

Include citations in the proper format (MLA, APA, Chicago, etc.) if you referenced sources.
